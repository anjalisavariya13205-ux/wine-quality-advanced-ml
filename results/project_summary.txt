WINE QUALITY CLASSIFICATION - ADVANCED ML + EXPLAINABLE AI
======================================================================

PROJECT SUMMARY:
* Dataset: Wine Quality (UCI Repository)
* Samples: 1599 wines
* Features: 11 physicochemical properties
* Task: Binary classification (Good vs Bad wine)

MODELS EVALUATED:
1. Classical ML (3 models):
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Random Forest

2. Advanced ML (3 models):
   - XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
   - LightGBM (Microsoft's Fast GB)
   - Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

BEST MODEL: XGBoost
* F1-Score: 0.8123 (81.23%)
* Accuracy: 0.8094

EXPLAINABLE AI METHODS APPLIED:
* SHAP (Global & Local explanations)
* LIME (Local interpretable approximations)
* Partial Dependence Plots
* Feature Importance Analysis

KEY FINDING:
* Alcohol content is the strongest predictor of wine quality
* Advanced models show 0.50% improvement over classical
* Model decisions are explainable and interpretable
